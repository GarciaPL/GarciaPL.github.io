Hi, I'm Lukasz!

I'm a Software Engineer based in London, UK, specializing in financial technology. I enjoy solving complex problems and building software that makes a real impact in the finance industry.

## What I Do

My work focuses on three main areas:

- **Private Markets Data** (current) - Designing solutions for financial information related to private equity, venture capital, real estate, private debt, and infrastructure investments. Most of my work focuses on pre-investment capabilities that enable Limited Partners such as Institutional Asset Owners, Asset Managers, and Private Wealth to supercharge their Front Office teams, including Strategy and Fund Investment, throughout the due diligence process and in investment decision-making.

- **Order Management Systems** - Developing tools that manage the entire trade lifecycle, from order placement through execution to settlement, compliance, and reporting.

- **Financial Indexes** - Building systems that track the performance of stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments. These benchmarks help measure market trends, investment returns, and economic performance.

## Why I Write

This blog is where I document things I learn and explore. Whether it's diving into Python internals, experimenting with new tools, understanding how trading systems work, or exploring financial markets from a domain perspective, not just a technical one. I find that writing helps me think more clearly and hopefully helps others along the way.

Feel free to reach out - I'm always happy to connect!
