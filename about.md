I am a results-driven and dedicated Software Engineer with a strong history of delivering impactful solutions within prestigious organizations and leading multifaceted projects. With a comprehensive grasp of technical intricacies, software development methodologies, and product lifecycle management, I've developed expertise across multiple domains.

Let's begin with my strong foundation in financial indexes (or indices), which are benchmarks that track the performance of a group of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments. Indexes provide a way to measure market trends, investment returns, and economic performance.

I've also developed expertise in order management systems, which serve as a crucial tool for traders, brokers, and asset managers to manage the entire lifecycle of trade orders, from order placement through execution to settlement, compliance, and reporting.

Furthermore, I have extensive experience in designing and implementing private markets data solutions, which refers to financial and investment information related to assets that are not publicly traded on stock exchanges. This includes private equity, venture capital, real estate, private debt, and infrastructure investments. 

Leveraging my technical skills in software development, data analysis, and problem-solving, I've successfully navigated the complexities of each field.

Currently based - UK, London
