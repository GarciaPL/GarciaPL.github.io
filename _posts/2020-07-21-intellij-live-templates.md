Recently I had a desire to explore a little bit of how static websites are generated using modern stack like React. I choose at the time open-source framework called 
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)

Gatsby has lots of advantages:
* Automatic routing based on your directory structure, so no extra code for configuring the router is needed
* Easily extensible by plugins
* Optimized for speed as only critical parts of your website are loaded
* Easy data integration with sources like CMSs, APIs, databases, file system (CSV, JSON, Markdown)

Using that technology I had created a simple project called __IntelliJ Live Templates__ which provides listings of live templates ready to be used by developers in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Explanation of how live templates are used is placed on a project website under section About.

Data to fill out the website is taken from the repository placed on Github in the form of Markdown files
